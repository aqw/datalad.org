DataLad aims to provide access to scientific data available from various
sources (e.g. lab or consortium web-sites such as `Human connectome
<http://humanconnectome.org>`_; data sharing portals such as `OpenFMRI
<http://openfmri.org>`_ and `CRCNS <http://crcns.org>`_) through a single
convenient interface and integrated with your software package managers (such
as APT in Debian).  Although initially targeting neuroimaging and neuroscience
data in general, it will not be limited by the domain and we would welcome a
wide range of contributions.
