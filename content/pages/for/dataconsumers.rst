Data are key to many applications, and while an enormous amount of data is
available, it is often not accessible in a form that would enable interested
parties to consume the relevant pieces efficiently, and to become aware when
any part of it changes, and maybe even why it changed.

For a growing number of data portals the DataLad teams provides `native
DataLad datasets </datasets.html>`__ that offer fine-grained access to current
and historic version of many datasets.

However, the vast majority of all available data are scattered around the web
using an incomprehensible variety of sites, access methods, and formats. In
order to help mitigate this complexity, DataLad provides equally tools to
monitor non-DataLad data sources on the web. With these tools DataLad users
are able to track their changes over time, curate them, and even re-publish
them native DataLad datasets.

The following demo shows how one can turn data and code posted on the companion
website of a textbook into a readily usable dataset.
