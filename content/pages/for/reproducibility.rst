DataLad is an ideal tool for conducting reproducible science. It can track and
`obtain shared data </for/dataconsumers.html>`__, and `publish results
</for/datasharing.html>`__. Importantly, it jointly manages analysis input
data, and associated analysis code as a complete representation of the critical
elements required to reproduce an analysis. On top of that it is able to
capture exactly how analysis code was executed in order to produce the results.
Altogether, DataLad can automatically capture an extensive provenance record,
with enough information in it to be able to rerun an analysis.

The following demo shows the complete setup, execution, and replication of a
brain imaging analysis on real data, in just five minutes. You'll see, how little
has to be done to automatically yield a reproducible outcome. You'll also see
how DataLad helps to maintain strict separation of inputs and outputs to clearly
identify what needs to be archived alongside a publication.
