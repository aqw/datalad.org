Datalad can track any data files that are published on the web. It is able
to monitor and incorporate modifications made to such data sources over time,
and to publish entire distributions of datasets created by this automated
process. The datalad team maintains data trackers for a number of public data
portals. The generated datasets are available at http://datasets.datalad.org

At present, this website offers uniform access to over 9TB of scientific
dataset. This includes data from:

- OpenFMRI
- NeuroVault
- International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI)
- Healthy Brain Network Serial Scanning Initiative (HBN-SSI)
- Data sharing for Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS.org)
- several individual research labs
