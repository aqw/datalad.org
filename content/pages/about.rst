This project aims to adapt the model of open-source software (OSS)
distributions to address the technical limitations of today's data-sharing and
develop all components of a "data distribution". The key concepts are:

1. Leverage - but do not replace - independent, existing, and future data
   hosting solutions to form a federated platform for data-sharing.
2. Employ software for data tracking and deployment logistics specialized for
   large data (git-annex_) built atop Git_, the most capable distributed version
   control system (dVCS) available today, to enable efficient data access at any
   level of granularity (from single files to entire collections of datasets).

DataLad will provide access to data available from a variety of sources (e.g.
lab or consortium web-sites such as http://humanconnectome.org; data sharing
portals such as http://openfmri.org and http://crcns.org) through a single
interface.  It will enable students and scientists to operate on data using
familiar concepts, such as files and directories, while transparently managing
data access and authorization with underlying hosting providers.
