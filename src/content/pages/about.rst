:menulabel: About

This project aims to adapt the model of open-source software (OSS)
distributions to address the technical limitations of today\'s
data-sharing and develop all components of a "data distribution". The
key concepts are: 1) Leverage - but do not replace - independent,
existing, and future data hosting solutions to form a federated
platform for data-sharing. 2) Employ software for data tracking and
deployment logistics specialized for large data (git-annex_) built
atop Git_, the most capable distributed version control system (dVCS)
available today, to enable efficient data access at any level of
granularity (from single files to entire collections of
datasets). DataLad will provide access to data available from various
sources (e.g. lab or consortium web-sites such as
http://humanconnectome.org; data sharing portals such as
http://openfmri.org and http://crcns.org) through a single
interface. It will enable students and scientists to operate on data
using familiar concepts, such as files and directories, while
transparently managing data access and authorization with underlying
hosting providers.

Historical note
===============

Originally project was named DataGit. It was later renamed into a more
distinctive DataLad to avoid Git trademark infringement.
