============================

This repository should contain everything to build a clone of the
website running at http://www.studyforrest.org

See the Makefile for information on dependencies. In short:

* Bootstrap
* JQuery
* dygraphs
* papaya viewer
* XTK

Dipy, FSL, and Nibabel are needed to produce the data demos on the site.
