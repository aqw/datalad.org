Sources for datalad.org website
===============================

This repository should contain everything to build a clone of the
website running at http://datalad.org .

This particular branch reflects the content of http://old.datalad.org -- the
"original" design which since then was replaced with a new one.

Needs ipython and nodejs to work to use that notebook rendering plugin!
