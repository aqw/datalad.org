    <p>DataLad aims to provide access to scientific data available from various
       sources (e.g. lab or consortium websites such as
       <a href="http://humanconnectome.org">Human connectome</a>;
       data sharing portals such as <a href="http://openfmri.org">OpenFMRI</a>
       and <a href="http://crcns.org">CRCNS</a>) through a single
       convenient interface and integrated with your software package managers
       (such as APT in Debian). Although initially targeting neuroimaging and
       neuroscience data in general, it is not limited by the domain and we
       welcome a wide range of contributions.</p>
