  <p>DataLad aims to provide access to scientific data available from various
     sources (e.g. lab or consortium websites such as
     <a href="http://humanconnectome.org">Human connectome</a>;
     data sharing portals such as <a href="http://openfmri.org">OpenFMRI</a>
     and <a href="http://crcns.org">CRCNS</a>) through a single
     convenient interface and integrated with your software package managers
     (such as APT in Debian). Although initially targeting neuroimaging and
     neuroscience data in general, it is not limited by the domain and we
     welcome a wide range of contributions.</p>

    <h2>Acquire</h2>
    <p>This is a <strong>one-of-a-kind resource</strong> for studying high-level cognition in
    the human brain under complex, natural stimulation. However, the
    versatility of the provided data, for some individuals almost ten hours of
    fMRI data alone, enables studies far beyond this main focus. This covers a
    vast range from studies of low-level signal properties and brain
    structure, over sensory integration and attentional processes, to
    computational modeling of representational spaces and brain area
    interactions. Take a look the <a class="reference external" href="http://studyforrest.org/publications.html">Publications Page</a> to get inspired.</p>

    <h2>Share</h2>
    <p>The <em>studyforrest</em> project provides <strong>ideal reference datasets</strong> for brain
    imaging. It's a comprehensive, modular, multi-modal, real-world dataset
    — making it an optimal choice when benchmarking algorithms or comparing
    implementations across projects.</p>
    <p>Liberally licensed (<a class="reference external" href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/">PDDL</a>) and hosted across many
    <a class="reference external" href="http://studyforrest.org/access.html">different services</a> (S3, rsync, OpenfMRI,
    etc) with fine-grained access options, the <em>studyforrest</em> dataset is
    easily accessible and is ready to be integrated into your CI
    infrastructure.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Extend</h2>
    <p>Not keen on brain research? This project still has something to offer to
    you! For example, our ongoing effort to analyze the <strong>structure of the
    movie "Forrest Gump"</strong> and annotate its properties continues to expand the
    breadth of topics that can be explored. Check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://studyforrest.org/data.html">Data Page</a> to see what is already in store.</p>
    <p>What we're most interested in, we admit, is that which we cannot
    anticipate. So please, invent applications and <strong>explore ideas you have</strong>
    that we aren't even aware of — yet.... and do tell us about them!</p>
