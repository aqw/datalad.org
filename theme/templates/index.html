      <h2>What is DataLad?</h2>
      <p>DataLad is an <strong>open source</strong> utility that brings the core
         concepts of version control systems to data â€” allowing
         <strong>versioning, branching, publishing, and merging</strong> with
         ease throughout the data lifecycle.</p>

      <p>Leveraging <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com">git-annex</a> and
         taking <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>'s concept of decentralization
         a step further, DataLad's "data handles" enable the selective acquisition
         of files and, when configured, across mirrors and a variety of transport
         methods (HTTP, FTP, rsync, BitTorrent, and more).</p>

      <p>The DataLad project also operates a crawler that regularly indexes
         datasets from scientific data portals such as
         <a href="http://openfmri.org">OpenFMRI</a> and
         <a href="http://crcns.org">CRCNS</a>, making them trivial to acquire
         and work with using datalad.</p>
